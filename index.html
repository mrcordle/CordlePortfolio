    <p>Hello my name is Matthew Cordle.  From an early age I have always been the computer guy in my family.  Coding and all things IT was a very big part of my life growing up all throughout High School and into College.  I am very excited to be learning the skills that I will need in order to get my foot in the door of the IT field.  Although lots have changed since the last time I was active in coding,  I cannot wait to be challenged to grow and become an outstanding developer.</p>
